# Letterboxd WikiData Film Report
A simple tool to that creates a 'report' on Letterboxd film pages for the corresponding WikiData item.
Useful to quickly see what data is missing from a film on WikiData.

I develop a browser extension, [Letterboxd Extras](https://github.com/duncanlang/Letterboxd-Extras) which uses WikiData. So I created this extension so I can easily see if a film has missing data while I browse Letterboxd.
I made this for my own personal use, but I decided to make it public just in case anyone else might want to use it.
