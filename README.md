# Letterboxd WikiData Film Report
A simple tool to that creates a 'report' on Letterboxd film pages for the corresponding WikiData item.
Useful to quickly see what data is missing from a film on WikiData.

This extension is mainly for my own personal use as I have being update film data on WikiData.
